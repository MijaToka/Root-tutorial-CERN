# Working With Files Learning Module
Welcome to the exercises of the **Working with Files** Learning Module!

## Writing and Reading histograms
This exercise is entirely based on notebooks.The instructions are embedded in the [notebook](WritingOnFilesExercise.ipynb) and your code soon will be as well! The solution is provided in the `solutions` folder. 

## TBrowser
If you're also using ROOT outside of the notebooks (e.g. you have ROOT installed on your machine or you're using lxplus), TBrowser is a very useful tool that allows to interactively inspect the contents of the ROOT files. 

In the terminal open the `histos.root` file with *root*
```root histos.root```
And open a **TBrowser**
```root[0] TBrowser b```
Now display the histograms: do they have the same content you saw in the notebook?
